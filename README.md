## Article on Software Development

I recently read an insightful article titled [Horizontal Autoscaling of NVIDIA NIM Microservices on 
Kubernetes](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/horizontal-autoscaling-of-nvidia-nim-microservices-on-kubernetes/). This article delves into the implementation of Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling 
(HPA) with NVIDIA NIM for Large Language Models (LLMs), showcasing how to automatically scale microservices based on custom metrics.

## Insights from the Article

The article provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a Kubernetes cluster with the necessary components to enable metric scraping and availability to the Kubernetes HPA service. It emphasizes 
the importance of understanding the compute and memory profiles of microservices in a production environment to establish an effective autoscaling strategy.

One aspect I found particularly intriguing is the detailed walkthrough of deploying a NIM microservice and configuring the HPA resource to scale based on the `gpu_cache_usage_perc` metric. This 
practical approach offers valuable insights into managing resource utilization efficiently, ensuring optimal performance of AI inference workloads.
